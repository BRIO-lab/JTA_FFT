# Joint Track Auto Fast Fourier Transform
MakeLib.py - this takes in an object model and projects it at various angles and generates resampled (x,y) contours.
NFD_Lib.py - this takes in the array of (x,y) contours generated by MakeLib and creates the variables needed for the Normalized-Fourier Descriptor-based matching algorithm.

## Pre-compilation steps:
***I would recommend running all commands and code in powershell, as it is what has worked for multiple people at this point. Install dependencies as needed, the commands used are below.*** 
*(these may not need to be installed depending on your machine)*

*Note: if the installation fails due to insufficient permissions, add "--user" after install, and before the name of the package (e.g. pip install --user vtk)*
**pip install --upgrade pip (this is to make sure your pip version is up to date, ***definitely*** do this)**
`pip install vtk`
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install scipy`
`pip install matplotlib`

To run `MakeLib.py` and `NFD_Lib.py`, create a new *.py* file, this will call the two other files. You can name it whatever you like, I used `example_call.py`
Place this code in the example call file you created:

`from MakeLib import MakeLib`
`from NFD_Lib import NFD_Lib`

`xout, yout = MakeLib('','3D Models/tib/ASCII_KR_left_8_tib.stl')` <-This line generates a figure of the .STL file you are projecting
`dc, mag, lib_angle, surface = NFD_Lib(xout,yout,1024)` <- This line generates the NFD library variables

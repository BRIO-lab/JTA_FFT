# Joint Track Auto Fast Fourier Transform
MakeLib.py - this takes in an object model and projects it at various angles and generates resampled (x,y) contours.
NFD_Lib.py - this takes in the array of (x,y) contours generated by MakeLib and creates the variables needed for the Normalized-Fourier Descriptor-based matching algorithm.

To run these, first compile both programs. Then you can call them like this:

`xout, yout = MakeLib('test/calibration.txt','test/ASCII_KR_left_8_tib.stl')`


and you should see a figure of whatever STL model you are projecting: orand then you can run

`dc, mag, lib_angle, surface = NFD_Lib(xout,yout,1024)` to generate the NFD library variables.
